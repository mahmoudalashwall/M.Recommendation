# NIBRAS Recommendation System

An intelligent recommendation model designed for the NIBRAS academic platform to help Computer Science students choose the most suitable specialization.

## 🎯 Project Goal
This project aims to assist Computer Science students in selecting their academic specialization based on their academic performance, practical experience, and technical skills.
Instead of random or peer-influenced choices, the system provides data-driven recommendations tailored to each student.

## 🧠 Recommendation Logic
The recommendation model analyzes multiple student attributes, including:
- GPA
- Degree and complexity of completed projects
- Technical and programming skills
- Academic performance in core CS subjects

Based on these factors, the system recommends suitable specializations such as:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Data Science
- Software Engineering
- Cyber Security
- Computer Networks

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset
- Type: Student academic and skills data
- Features include:
  - GPA
  - Number and quality of projects
  - Skill proficiency levels
  - Course performance indicators
- Format: CSV
- Source: Simulated or anonymized academic data for educational purposes
